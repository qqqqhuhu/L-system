# Instructions

## Basic information

- Clion
- MSVC
- C++ 17 
- OpenCV 4.6.0
- CMake

## Config file 

- First row: number of repetitions, n
- Second row: angle, angle
- Third row: default length of drawn line
- Fourth row: initial string
- Fifth row: number of mapping relations
- Sixth row: mapping relation 1
- Seventh row: mapping relationship 2....


## Short keys instruction

- The number keys 1-9 correspond to each of the 9 figures

- w,e for decreasing and increasing the length of the line
- s,d for decreasing and increasing the angle
- x,c for decreasing and increasing the number of iterations

- j,k,l,i represent the left, bottom, right and top translation directions of the overall image respectively
- u,o, represent the sit-rotation and right-rotation of the overall image respectively

## Other information

- Important] The path to the configuration file
  - Due to the special configuration of my computer and the use of CMake for this project, if you need to run this project you will need to modify the path of the project to suit your situation
  - The locations are as follows

- Iteration keys, (x,c for decreasing and increasing the number of iterations respectively)
- Replace image, (number keys 1-9 for each of the 9 graphics)
- Hotkey change three configurations
  - (ten hotkeys are implemented)
    - w,e for decreasing and increasing the length of the line
    - s,d for decreasing and increasing the angle

    - j,k,l,i for the left, bottom, right and top translation directions of the overall image
    - u,o, represent the sit-rotation and right-rotation of the overall image respectively
